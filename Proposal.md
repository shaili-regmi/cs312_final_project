# Particle Planetarium

## CS312 Final Project Proposal - Bryn Mawr College 2021

*A planetarium of animated stars, comets, and meteors with a space skybox cubemap as the background and a rotating (maybe, fly-through) camera.*

This project will be unique from other existing demos as it will simulate an animated shooting star/meteor/comet scene with multiple particles inside a skybox cubemap.
The camera will rotate around with the cursor (or maybe, fly through) to look around the whole scene.
Multiple particles will be used:

- A rock-like particle for the comet core/meteor that moves around the scene.

- An animated glowing comet tail that moves with the core and gets brighter or lighter each frame.

- Probably some randomly placed star particles that twinkle using a glow texture.

## Features planned and timeline for implementation:

*Minimum required*

5-10-2021 - Full sort to remove any black squares surrounding the particles

5-12-2021 - Skybox/Cubemap

5-15-2021 - Multiple texture support

5-17-2021 - A full-scene with animated shooting stars/meteors/comets

5-17-2021 - A rotating camera


*Good-to-have*

5-18-2021 - Randomly placed twinkling stars


*Stretch*

5-20-2021 - A fly-through camera


## Algorithms and Data Structures
